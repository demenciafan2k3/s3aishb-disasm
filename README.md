Sonic The Hedgehog 3A as it should have been. Fair and simple.
It adds:
-Carnival Night, IceCap, Launch Base, Competition, Knuckles, Credits and Act 1 Boss tunes from Sonic Origins;
-Knuckles, as a playable character;
-Flying Battery, sandwiched between Carnival Night and IceCap as originally intended before issues arose.
As of writing only the former is implemented, but will start work on the rest pretty soon.
