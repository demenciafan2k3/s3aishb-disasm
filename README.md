Sonic The Hedgehog 3A as it should have been. Fair and simple.
It adds:
-Carnival Night, IceCap, Launch Base, Competition, Knuckles, Credits and Act 1 Boss tunes from Sonic Origins;
-Knuckles, as a playable character;
-Flying Battery, sandwiched between Carnival Night and IceCap as originally intended before issues arose.
As of March 2025, everything is implemented, but there's a lot of bugs so... you don't get anything.
